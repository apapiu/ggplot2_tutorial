# ggplot2_tutorial
Presentation for the St. Louis  R meetup

If you want to run the code on your own machine: click on UseR_presentation.Rmd above, then right-click on the raw button and select the "Save content as..." "UseR_presentation.Rmd". Then simply open UseR_presentation.Rmd in RStudio. If you're not too familiar with RMarkdown read more about it [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). 

I recommend updating RStudio (go to help - check for updates in RStudio) so you can run the chunks in the Rmd file and see the output inline.


You can also just click [here](http://rpubs.com/apapiu/ggplot2_tutorial) for an html version of the tutorial.
